# Firearm-AI-Detection-Program

Hello!


You're free to test out this program in Visual Studio Code! 


"Firearm_Detection_Demo_Normal" and "Firearm_Detection_Demo_Fast" can be directly run. 
"Firearm_Detection_Normal_Gmail" and "Firearm_Detection_Fast_Gmail" need a Gmail developer token passcode to run. 
I am not sharing my personal token passcode file ("client_secret.json") here for security reasons, but you can email me at 
2023zhaoe83@gmail.com to request mine or go to the following link to create your own: https://github.com/jeremyephron/simplegmail#getting-started


Here are a few things to note about each of the files:


"Firearm_Detection_Demo_Normal":
Demonstrates firearm detection. A window will pop up on your screen that visually displays and highlights the 
identified firearm. Detection speed is at <5 fps. To exit the running program, hit the letter "q". 

"Firearm_Detection_Demo_Fast": 
Demonstrates firearm detection. A window will pop up on your screen that visually displays and highlights the 
identified firearm. Detection speed is at >30 fps. To exit the running program, hit the letter "q". 
Depending on your program environment, sometimes the program may crash on the first run. In the event that it 
crashes, just run it again and it will work fine. 

"Firearm_Detection_Normal_Gmail":
Detects firearms and sends email alerts upon detection. The demonstration window with the visual display and 
highlights will not pop up, but a screenshot of the identification and the highlight will be attached to the email. 
Detection speed is at <5 fps. To exit the running program, hit the letter "q". 

"Firearm_Detection_Fast_Gmail":
Detects firearms and sends email alerts upon detection. The demonstration window with the visual display and 
highlights will not pop up, but a screenshot of the identification and the highlight will be attached to the email. 
Detection speed is at >30 fps. To exit the running program, hit the letter "q". 
Depending on your program environment, sometimes the program may crash on the first run. In the event that it
